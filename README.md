# hibernate-interceptors

## This project handles the following:

1) Declares a **custom Hibernate interceptor** for intercepting entities, suitable for future audit implementation.

2) Shows how **N+1 problem** can occur and how to fix it with **JOIN FETCH**

3) Shows how **equality should be implemented in Entities** also handling Proxy test cases.

4) Detect **N+1** problem and **inefficient queries** in tests with query counters and proxy listeners.

5) Shows **entities states** and how they **managed in a transaction**.
